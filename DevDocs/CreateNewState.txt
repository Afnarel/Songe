/* To add a new State, we need to :
 *   - create a class MyState derived from class State
 *   - implement the abstract methods defined in State (init, update, render)
 *   - add a new name in the StateName enum in StateManager
 *   - add a new "case" in StateManager::enterState to associate this name with the class
 *   - don't forget the include of the new class in StateManager.h and modify the Makefile !
